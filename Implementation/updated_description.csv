Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a blood-borne viral infection of the liver that can present acutely or chronically, leading to jaundice, fatigue, and risk of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma."
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a blood-transmitted viral infection that often becomes chronic, causing liver inflammation, fibrosis, and increased risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer."
Hepatitis D,"Hepatitis D is a defective RNA virus requiring hepatitis B for replication, resulting in more severe liver inflammation and accelerated disease progression."
Hepatitis E,"Hepatitis E is an acute, fecal-oral transmitted viral liver infection, typically self-limited but severe in pregnant women, causing jaundice and flu-like symptoms."
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is liver inflammation caused by excessive alcohol consumption, presenting with jaundice, hepatomegaly, fever, and elevated liver enzymes."

Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"Dimorphic hemorrhoids (piles) refers to swollen and inflamed veins in the lower rectum and anus, causing pain, itching, bleeding, and discomfort exacerbated by straining."
Heart attack,"Heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when blood flow to heart muscle is blocked, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, and potential heart damage."
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted veins resulting from valve dysfunction, leading to leg pain, swelling, and a heavy sensation."
Hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism is underactive thyroid gland resulting in low thyroid hormone levels, leading to fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance."
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is overactive thyroid gland causing excess thyroid hormone production, resulting in weight loss, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness."
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is abnormally low blood glucose levels, leading to trembling, sweating, confusion, and in severe cases, seizures or loss of consciousness."
Osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthristis is a degenerative joint disease where cartilage breakdown leads to joint pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility, commonly affecting the knees, hips, and hands."
Arthritis,"Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints, causing pain and stiffness."
(vertigo) Paroymsal Positional Vertigo,(Vertigo) Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is a vestibular disorder where displaced inner ear crystals cause brief episodes of intense dizziness triggered by head movements.
